### NOTE-Bewertung Nachher

|ID|Vorher|Nachher|Begründung|
|---|---|---|---|
|4.2 Trusted base|PARTIAL|**PASS**|Wolfi (Chainguard Official) = trusted source + daily rebuild; EOL-Problem von Buster eliminiert|
|4.3 Unnecessary pkgs|PARTIAL|**PASS**|Wolfi-Runtime ist distroless-Charakter; massive Paketreduktion (Trivy: 0 OS-Vulns belegt minimaler Footprint)|
|4.4 Scanned & rebuilt|FAIL|**PASS**|GitHub Actions Workflow + weekly cron + `--no-cache --pull` implementiert|
|4.8 SUID/SGID|FAIL|**PASS**|Wolfi-Runtime enthält strukturell keine SUID/SGID-Binaries (Chainguard-Eigenschaft, optional verifizierbar via Tarball-Inspektion)|
|4.10 Secrets|PASS|**PASS**|unverändert|
|4.11 Verified packages|FAIL|**PASS**|`pip install --require-hashes` + pip-compile-generierte SHA256-Hashes für alle 8 Pakete|
|4.12 Signed artifacts|FAIL|**out-of-scope**|kein Registry-Workflow → kein realer Substitutions-Vektor; im Ausblick als Empfehlung|
|5.23 exec --privileged|PASS|**PASS**|unverändert|
|5.24 exec --user=root|FAIL|**PASS**|Container läuft als uid 65532; `docker exec` ohne `--user` läuft strukturell nonroot|

### Out-of-Scope-Klassifikation (gilt für Vorher UND Nachher)

Damit der Score-Vergleich methodisch sauber ist, müssen out-of-scope-Controls in beiden Messungen gleich behandelt werden:

|ID|Begründung|
|---|---|
|4.5 Content Trust|Mechanismus seit 2022 deprecated; kein Registry-Workflow im PoC|
|4.12 Signed Artifacts|kein Registry-Workflow im PoC|
|5.2 AppArmor|Proxmox-LXC bietet kein nested AppArmor-Subsystem|

5.9 (Port 5000 WARN) **bleibt drin** — ehrlich, dass docker-bench heuristisch warnt; in Diskussion erwähnen.

### Score-Rechnung (konsistente Logik beide Messungen)

||Vorher|Nachher|
|---|---|---|
|PASS auto|18|30|
|PASS manuell|2|8|
|**Σ PASS**|**20**|**38**|
|WARN auto|11 (13 − 2 OOS)|1 (5.9)|
|FAIL manuell|4 (5 − 1 OOS)|0|
|PARTIAL|2|0|
|**Σ nicht-PASS**|**17**|**1**|
|INFO ausgeschlossen|4|2|
|Out-of-scope|3|3|
|**Scope**|**37**|**39**|
|**Score**|**54,1 %**|**97,4 %**|

**Δ = +43,3 Prozentpunkte.**
